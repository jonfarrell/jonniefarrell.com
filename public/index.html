He has mastered the technique of muscle toning and weight loss. For such a young age, he is very knowledgeable in fitness training. He demonstrates and explains clearly the exercise program, how it works and which muscle is being targeted. I was lucky to have him as my personal trainer and owe him a lot in getting back to my fitness. His workout program is very effective which resulted to the 5 kilos I lost in just 2 months.
