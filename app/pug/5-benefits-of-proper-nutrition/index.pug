              h6 Bone and Teeth strength
              p A diet rich in calcium keeps your bones and teeth strong and helps prevent bone loss associated with osteoporosis. Low-fat dairy products, such as milk, cheese and yogurt; dark green vegetables, such as bok choy and broccoli are good sources of calcium. Vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium so choose products with vitamin D to balance your nutrition.

              h6 Energy
              p Increased energy levels are the immediate benefits of switching to a healthy diet. Eliminating excess fats, sugars and refined carbohydrates helps prevent blood sugar fluctuations. Examples of refined carbohydrates include candy and white breads. Unprocessed carbohydrates including whole grains, fruits and vegetables are most nutritious. This allows you to maintain steady blood sugar and constant energy levels as a result. Small, frequent meals also help maintain energy. In addition, eating a healthy breakfast helps keep you energized throughout the day.

              h6 Brain Health
              p Proper nutrition increases blood flow to your brain, protecting brain cells and helping to prevent Alzheimer's disease. For a brain healthy diet, avoid fried foods. Also, eat dark fruits and vegetables such as kale, spinach, broccoli, prunes, raisins, blueberries, raspberries, plums and cherries. Almonds, walnuts, pecans and other nuts are great sources of vitamin E, which along with other vitamins, also helps fight Alzheimer's disease.
            li
              h6 Weight Control
              p To prevent weight gain, you must eat no more calories than you burn each day. For weight loss, you must eat fewer calories than your body burns daily. Healthy and nutrient-dense foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean proteins, typically contain fewer calories than soft drink, sweets and fast food meals. Shedding excess kilograms reduces your risk of obesity-related conditions such as type-2 diabetes, clogged arteries and thyroid dysfunction.
