              h6 Increase Entire Body Strength & Muscle
              p Obviously, squats build strong legs which help support the entire body. But they also promote body wide muscle building. If you're squatting correctly, you'll be causing your body to release testosterone which is important for building muscle and increasing muscle mass, especially when you work out other areas of the body.

            li
              h6 Burn Fat
              p Squats are an efficient way of burning fat as this process occurs even after you've stopped exercising. After all, one of the most time efficient ways to burn more calories is to gain more muscle!

            li
              h6 Increase Flexibility & Prevent Injuries
              p Flexibility is an important aspect of injury prevention. Our muscles, tendons and ligaments become less elastic with age so doing all we can to slow down this process is a good idea. Doing squats regularly will see you become more flexible as they involve bending and stretching of the leg muscles including the quadriceps, hamstrings and calves.
            li
              h6 Build Core Strength
              p The muscles, bones, and joints that link your upper and lower body are known as the core. This is probably the most important muscle group in the body. During our normal, everyday life we engage our core constantly â€“ during lifting, twisting, reaching and bending. Squats are one of the best exercises for a strong core as we must engage the stomach muscles and lower back when performing them.
            li
              h6 Improves Circulation
              p The circulatory system relies heavily on body movements to function properly, which is why squats is one of the best exercises to increase circulation. Squats get your heart pounding and blood pumping.
